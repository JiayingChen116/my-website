Hi, I am *Jiaying Chen*. I am from *Shanghai, China*. I graduated from the School of Economics of *Peking University*, majoring in Finance. In 2019, I spend a wonderful time as an exchange studen at Mendoza Business School in the University of Notre Dame in U.S. Now I am reading for Masters in Analytics and Management degree in London Business School. 

I would use three keywords to describe my characteristic:
-   Curious
-   Reliable
-   Compassionate

This is my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaying-chen-0934) where you can find more information about my past experience.

In my spare time, I am a traveler, photographer and dancer! I also enjoy playing sports with my friends. Fencing, archery and squash are my favorites. I am especially fond of arts. I have learned painting since my childhood and won over 15 awards. And my favorite artist is Bato Dugarzhapov. Here is one of my favorite works.
